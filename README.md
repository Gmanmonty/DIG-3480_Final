I made some changes from the tutorial three for challenge 3 but, I only made the required changes that were in tier 1. I did not complete the other changes for the other tiers. I added more health collectibles, changed the tilemap to add more bodies of water, two broken robots, and adds particle effects.
The visual changes I did for the final project is completely different from challenge 3, I started out by moving all the objects and sprites to outside the game border, then I erased the entire tilemap and created a completely new tilemap and then moved the objects and sprites back onto the board but in different spots.
The audio changes that I made were pretty basic I added audio to Jambi when the player gets near the sprite and I also added audio to the other NPC that I created for the final project. One of the audio sources was from the audio that was given in the tutorial package but for the other I downloaded a new audio package from unity to get more sounds.
One of the gameplay changes that I made to the game is that I added another NPC like the Jambi sprite except I added the dog sprite from a earlier project that when they have completed the game they go to the dog and the message will say they have completed their mission and asks the question want to continue the quest. The other gameplay change I made to the game was a new hazard to the game that ruby will have to avoid, the enemy is similar to the bots but i used a different sprite and i added that the dragon sprites will move vertically and the bots will move horizontally.
